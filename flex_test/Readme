Problem 2:

Light Sensor App:

Sense the light intensity values for every 3 seconds. 

old_intensity = Average of the last 10 intensity values
curr_intensity = Current light intensity (at the measuring time instant)

If curr_intensity is lesser than old_intensity, switch on red LED.
If curr_intensity is equal to old_intensity, switch on Green LED. 
If curr_intensity is greater than old_intensity, switch on amber LED. 


* We have used PhotoC component which provides an interface for reading values from the LDR in mda100 board.

* Values from the LDR are buffered(recent 10 values) and averaged and stored as old_intensity.

* Current value of intensity is compared with old_intesity is compared with old_intensity and appropriate Led is switched on.

* All of this is done in readDone() callback event.
